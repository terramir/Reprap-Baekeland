hi this is terramir

This is the start of a journey in order to make an almost fully reprappable  reprap, the only vitamin besides motors electronics and bed should be Little Steel Balls (yeah yeah there's a joke in there somewhere), and well they could be replaced by high temperature PLA if this was on the market. 
Will be posting as created it's rough to say the least. Don't go printing this yet. will announce in this readme when it is even in beta stage.
Right now these designs are pre-alpha!!!!
happy reprapping
